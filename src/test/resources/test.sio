$x0 # What's this?
# - It's a way to declare your own registers, if you need them.

#run this once
@mov 100 acc
mov acc stdout # stdout? What's that?
# - stdout is a register that you can use to write to stdout :)
# What does it write?
# - whatever you give it. It can be string or it can be binary data. It's just like stdout.

sub 1

mov "\n" stdout # A string literal?
# - exactly!

tlt acc 1
+ mov "done\n" stdout
+ end # I can guess what this instruction does...
# - yeah.
